# SciPy
Some physics problems resolved with Python, mainly SciPy 

1- Bolztmann distribution with Monte Carlo Method. Distribution of energy in the molecules of a gas. 

2- Finding roots of nonlinear equations with different methods: bisection method, regula falsi and Newton-Raphson method; and comparing them with the one offered in SciPy: fsolve. Van der Waals equation compared with the ideal gas law.

3- Integration with different methods: Montecarlo, AGM (arithmeticâ€“geometric mean) and the midpoint rule; and comparing them with the one offered in SciPy: quad. Obtaining the period of a pendulum. 

4- Solving ordinary differential equations with different methods: Euler, Euler-Cromer and Runge-Kutta 2; and comparing them with the one offered in SciPy: solve_ivp. Calculating the velocity and position of a fall. 

5- Finding the minimun of a function with different methods and comparing them with the one offered in SciPy: fmin. Finding the minimun velocity of the surface waves in a liquid. 

6- A programm with argparse where you can enter different types of parameters and returns a graph with that information. (Argparse module needed).

For this programms, you will need to have NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy installed.
